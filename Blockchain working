Whenever a transaction occurs it is broadcasted to all the peers in the network. The miners started to verify the transaction. After validating legitimacy
of the transaction, the peers started to solve for nonce. Whoever first get the nonce value informs all the peers. Rest of the peers stop solving and start
verifying the nonce value. After verification if the value is correct all the peers add block to its chain. 
This process takes time and meanwhile other transactions also take place. Whenever a new transaction is broadcasted , all the peers get the transaction details
and store it in transaction pool and further broadcast to the network and when the current block processing is done, it takes new transaction from the pool
and start solving for new transaction and the process keeps going on.

For the creation of a block, hash value is required which is generated by using transaction details (time stamp, amount etc). In general generating hash is quite
simple. But blockchain adds some diffculty by adding some restrictions to the hash generated. Like it should start with 0000 (This is just for example, in actual 
the difficulty level is high) Now we know that one input will always give same hash. Here the concept of nonce comes. Nonce is the unknown value which when combined
with the input should generate hash that starts with 0000. The miners are actually working to find the nonce value.

/************************BITCOIN TRANSACTION********************************/
The fundamental concept of bitcoin network is UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)
UTXO: Set of all UTXOs collectively define the state of the bitcoin blockchain.
      UTXOs are input to the transactions and also the output of the transaction.
      All UTXOs are stored in a system by the participant nodes.
      It stores data about transactions.
      UTXOs have:
        Identifier of the transaction that created the UTXO
        Index of this UTXO in the UTXO list
        Value/ Amount
        Optional Script (Which may include some condition for transaction)
        More about UTXO: https://smithandcrown.com/glossary/unspent-transaction-outputs-utxo/
 
Transactions have:
  Reference no of current transaction.
  Reference to one or more input UTXO
  Reference to one or more output UTXO (Generated by current transaction)
  Total input and output amount
  
  
  /***************Operations in a blockchain***********************/
  1. Validation of transactions
  2. Gathering of transactions for a block
  3. Broadcasting valid transactions and blocks
  4. Consensus on next block creation
  5. Chaining blocks
  
  
  /*********************Types of blockchain(on the basis of functionality)*****************/
  1. Only Cryptocurrency e.g Bitcoin
  2. Cryptocurrency+ business logic e.g Etherium
  3. Only business logic e.g Hyperledger
  
  
    /*********************Categories of blockchain(on the basis of access rights)*****************/
  1. Public e.g Bitcoin
  2. Private e.g Used by a single organization
  3. Permissioned/Cnsortium e.g Used by group of organizations like all healthcare departments
