High level:
Whenever a transaction occurs it is broadcasted to all the peers in the network. The miners started to verify the transaction. After validating legitimacy
of the transaction, the peers started to solve for nonce. Whoever first get the nonce value informs all the peers. Rest of the peers stop solving and start
verifying the nonce value. After verification if the value is correct all the peers add block to its chain. 
This process takes time and meanwhile other transactions also take place. Whenever a new transaction is broadcasted , all the peers get the transaction details
and store it in transaction pool and further broadcast to the network and when the current block processing is done, it takes new transaction from the pool
and start solving for new transaction and the process keeps going on.

For the creation of a block, hash value is required which is generated by using transaction details (time stamp, amount etc). In general generating hash is quite
simple. But blockchain adds some diffculty by adding some restrictions to the hash generated. Like it should start with 0000 (This is just for example, in actual 
the difficulty level is high) Now we know that one input will always give same hash. Here the concept of nonce comes. Nonce is the unknown value which when combined
with the input should generate hash that starts with 0000. The miners are actually working to find the nonce value.

/************************BITCOIN TRANSACTION********************************/

Transaction: Transactions encode the transfer of value between participants in the system. In more detail, a transaction is a data structure that encodes 
a transfer of value from a source of funds called an “input” to a destination called an “output”.

The fundamental concept of bitcoin network is UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)
UTXO: Set of all UTXOs collectively define the state of the bitcoin blockchain.
      UTXOs are input to the transactions and also the output of the transaction.
      All UTXOs are stored in a system by the participant nodes.
      It stores data about transactions.
      UTXOs have:
        Identifier of the transaction that created the UTXO
        Index of this UTXO in the UTXO list
        Value/ Amount
        Optional Script (Which may include some condition for transaction)
        More about UTXO: https://smithandcrown.com/glossary/unspent-transaction-outputs-utxo/
 
Transactions have:
  Reference no of current transaction.
  Reference to one or more input UTXO
  Reference to one or more output UTXO (Generated by current transaction)
  Total input and output amount
  
 

Transactions also maintains its chain. For example if person A has sent 2 BTC to person B. Person A writes 2.0005 BTC as its input and 2BTC as output
Assuming that 0.0005 is the transaction fee. Now if person B wants to send 1 BTC to person C, he can't write 1 BTC as input. The rule is to write the whole
transaction's output as new input. Person B will write 2BTC as input and 1 BTC as output to person C bitcoin address and the rest of the amount 
(called unspent output or change) i.e 1BTC will be sent to own bitcoin address.

A single person may have several wallets and several bitcoin addresses. Some wallets sent the unspent amount another bitcoin address of the same person.
By using different address anonymity is achieved.
  
/***************************FORMS OF TRANSACTIONS IN BITCOIN*******************************/

Single input: Input is from any one previous transaction. It may also involve change return. (Example above)
Aggregate input: Combines (add) inputs from several previous transactions
      Example: Person A sent me 2BTC and person B also sent me 1BTC Now if I want to send person C 3BTC. This form of transaction will be used
Distribute input: Distributes one input to multiple outputs.
      Example: Person A sent me 2BTC and I want to send 1BTC to person B and 1 BTC to person C. This form of transaction will be used.
The choice of the form of transaction is done by wallet at the back, we don't need to worry about it.

  /***************Operations in a blockchain***********************/
  1. Validation of transactions
  2. Gathering of transactions for a block
  3. Broadcasting valid transactions and blocks
  4. Consensus on next block creation
  5. Chaining blocks
  
  
  /*********************Types of blockchain(on the basis of functionality)*****************/
  1. Only Cryptocurrency e.g Bitcoin
