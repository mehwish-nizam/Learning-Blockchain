Types of variables: 
1. Value type(e.g bool,uint,int,address,byte,enum)
A type is referred as value type if it holds the data (value) directly within the memory owned by it.
These types have values stored with them, instead of elsewhere
Value types are types that do not take more than 32 bytes of memory in size.

******Passing By value************
1. When a value type variable is assigned to another variable or when a value type variable is sent as an argument to a function, EVM creates a new 
variable instance and copies the value of original value type into target variable.
2. Changing values in original or target variables will not affect the value in another variable.
3. Both the variables will maintain their independent, isolated values


2. Reference type(e.g )
Reference types, unlike value types, do not store their values directly within the variables themselves.
Instead of the value, they store the address of the location where the value is stored.
The variable holds the pointer to another memory location that holds the actual data.
Reference types are types that can take more than 32 bytes of memory in size.

*******Passing by reference*************
When a reference type variable is assigned to another variable or when a reference type variable is sent as an argument to a function, EVM creates a new 
variable instance and copies the pointer from the original variable into the target variable.
Both the variables are pointing to the same address location
Changing values in the original or target variables will change the value in other variables Also.

Points to remember:
Assignments to state variable from another state variable always creates a new copy for both value type and reference type
Assignments to storage variables from another memory variable always create a new copy for both value type and reference type
Assignments to memory variable from another state variable always creates a new copy for both value type and reference type
Assignments to a memory variable from anothermemory variable DO NOT create a copy for reference types(Different) However, they do create a new copy for value types.
