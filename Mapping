Mapping is a reference type as arrays and structs. Following is the syntax to declare a mapping type.
mapping(_KeyType => _ValueType)
Mapping can only have type of storage and are generally used for state variables.

Things to remember in mapping: 
The key cannot be types mapping ,dynamic array ,enum and struct.
The values can be of any type.
Mappings are always stored in storage irrespective of whether they are
declared in contract storage or not.


Example:
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract LedgerBalance {
   mapping(address => uint) public balances;

   function updateBalance(uint newBalance) public {
      balances[msg.sender] = newBalance;
   }
}
contract Updater {
   function updateBalance() public returns (uint) {
      LedgerBalance ledgerBalance = new LedgerBalance();
      ledgerBalance.updateBalance(10);
      return ledgerBalance.balances(address(this));
   }
}
