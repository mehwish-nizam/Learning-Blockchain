Token is a digital asset that is stored securely on the blockchain.

Token and Cryptocurrency are two differen things...
A cryptocurrency is a standard currency used for making or receiving payments on a blockchain
A token represents a tradable asset or utility that resides on its own blockchain and allows the holder to use it for investment or economic purposes. 
Cryptocurrency is a superset of blockchain



Tokens that reside on blockchains include reward tokens, currency tokens, utility tokens, security tokens, equity token, and asset tokens. 
Things we can do with tokens but not with cryptocurrency
1) Grant access to some service
2) Verify certificates/documents
3) Used as a currency for payment 
4) Give authorization of digital asset to some entity
5) Sell or register shares of a company


Fungible amd Non fungible Tokens:
Fungibility: It is a property of an asset whose individual units are easily interchangable.
eg. one 100Rs note can be changed with another 100Rs note

Fungible Tokens: Individual tokens can be interchanged.
Non-fungible Tokens: Individual tokens can't be interchanged. (e.g One painting can't be interchanged with another)


Intrinsic and Etrinsic Values of token:
Itrinstic means value within the token (e.g For 100Rs note 100 is its intrinsic value that is written on the note).
Extrinsic means token represents some outsider asset (e.g One token = 10g Gold)

ERC20 is the standard for ethereum token
