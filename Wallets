A cryptocurrency wallet is simply a place where you store your private keys

Non-deterministic Wallets
Private keys are generated randomly. After generating it can never be traced back and have no association with each other.
The more traditional approach to wallets was called non-deterministic wallets. These wallets came with randomly generated private
keys and were able to generate further random keys when requested. Whilst at the outset from a security perspective this sounds a 
positive thing, none of the keys having a relationship to each other creates a management headache. Since there is no relationship 
between any of the keys each and every key must be backed up. As you generate more and more keys the management challenge increases.

Deterministic wallets:
Private keys are generated from some seed word and can be traced back and determined
Two types of deterministic wallets:
1. Sequential deterministic wallets
    Seed ---> Private keys
2. Hierarchial deterministic wallets
Seed---> Master key ---> Child keys(multiple) ---> Grandchilds(multiple)-----
