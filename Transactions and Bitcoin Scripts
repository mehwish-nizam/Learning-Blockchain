Blocks contain transactions. In block header,we have four elements
1. Previous block hash
2, Time
3. Merkle root
4. Nonce

Then there are no of transactions in a block.

Transactions encode the transfer of value between participants in the system.
In more detail, a transaction is a data structure that encodes a transfer of value from a source of funds called an “input” to a destination called 
an “output”.
Transaction in the bitcoin blockchain are stored in a double-hashed form 
i.e(SHA256(SHA256(01000…)) = b138360800cdc72248c3ca8dfd06de85913d1aac7f41b4fa54eb1f5a4a379081)
A raw transtions has:
1. Version no
2. No of inputs
3. Input info (input unlocking scripts i.e the conditions which should be met for spending this input)
4. No of outputs
5. Output info (output locking scripts i.e the conditions for spending output in the future e.g Lock the output with Bob's public key means only bob can
                use these bitcoins with his private key and will form the basis of unlocking scripts of future transactions)
6. Locktime Time for transaction if this is 00000 then transaction should added asap
                                 if its less than 500 million it will be block height (Block height is the no of blocks from genesis block)
                                 (Miners wait for specific no of blocks to be created before this transaction)
                                 if its greater than 500 million, it is read as UNIX timestamp(no of seconds from 1st jan 1970)
                                 

Scripts:
List of instructions to determine if the transaction is valid and the bitcoins can be spent.
Bitcoin script is written in a stack based scripting language called Script. We can interact with the data using opcodes. (push, pop etc)

Attributes of bitcoin scripts:
Stateless verification: No state or value is saved outside the transaction script before or after the transcation. Transaction are self contained 
which means that scripts will be executed in the same way and generate the same output on any node.
Turing completeness: No loop or recursion prevents from stucking into an infinite loop and crashing the network.
