Blockchain: Blockchain is distributed, decentralized and immutable public ledger.
Decentralized and Distributed: A decentralized system is a subset of a distributed system.
Decentralized means that there is no single point where the decision is made.
Distributed means that the processing is shared across multiple nodes, but the decisions may still be centralized and use complete system knowledge.
Concept of cryptocurrency (bitcoin) was given by a mysterious person called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008
Blockchain enables peer to peer P2P transaction.
P2P: A group of computers are linked together with equal permissions and responsibilities for processing data. No server client concept.
Since there is no central authority, the mechanism is required to solve security and trust issues.
To establish trust among unknown peers, blockchain implements software programs for validation and Concensus.
Validation verifies that the transactions is legal (not malicious, double spends etc).
Consensus involves agreeing on the ordering of validated transactions.
First validation then concensus
The algorithm for consensus in the Bitcoin blockchain is called Proof of work protocol.

/******************************* TYPES OF NODES IN A BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK************************************/

A node is any computer that connects to the blockchain network, for instance, any computer connected to the Bitcoin network can be regarded as a Bitcoin node.

The nodes are of three types:

REFERENCE CLIENT (Bitcoin core) MINER NODE: 
      Contains wallet, mining, full blockchain database and network routing mode on the P2P network.
      Miner nodes can propose blocks and have the complete history of the blockchain.
      
Full Blockchain Node:
    Contains full blockchain database and network routing mode on the P2P network.
    Full nodes have the complete history of the blockchain but cannot propose new blocks 
    
Lightweight SPV wallet: 
    Contains wallet and a network mode on the P2P protocol without blockchain.
    It doesn't download the entire copy of the blockchain.
    It relies on full nodes for blockchain history.
