Blockchain: Blockchain is distributed, decentralized and immutable public ledger.
Decentralized and Distributed: A decentralized system is a subset of a distributed system.
Decentralized means that there is no single point where the decision is made.
Distributed means that the processing is shared across multiple nodes, but the decisions may still be centralized and use complete system knowledge.
Concept of cryptocurrency (bitcoin) was given by a mysterious person called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008
Blockchain enables peer to peer P2P transaction.
P2P: A group of computers are linked together with equal permissions and responsibilities for processing data. No server client concept.
Since there is no central authority, the mechanism is required to solve security and trust issues.
To establish trust among unknown peers, blockchain implements software programs for validation and Concensus.
Validation verifies that the transactions is legal (not malicious, double spends etc).
Consensus involves agreeing on the ordering of validated transactions.
First validation then concensus
The algorithm for consensus in the Bitcoin blockchain is called Proof of work protocol.
