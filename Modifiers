Modifiers: 
1. If we want to apply validation before executing logic of function so we can use modifier and decide in modifier whether target function should be executed.
2. This helps in writing cleaner functions without cluttering them with validation and verification rules.
3. Moreover, the modifier can be associated with multiple functions. This ensures cleaner, more readable, and more maintainable code.

address owner;
modifier onlyBy () {
   if (msg.sender == owner) {
      _;
   }}
An _ underscore in a modifier means: execute the target function. You can think of this as the underscore being replaced by the target function inline

function getValues () public view onlyBy returns (uint) {
   return 56;
   }
