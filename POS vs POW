“Proof of work” and “proof of stake” are the two major consensus mechanisms cryptocurrencies use to verify new transactions, add them to the blockchain, 
and create new tokens. 
Proof of work is used in bitcoin blockchain and proof of stake is used in ethereum.

In proof of work, miners compete with each other to solve for hash value and the first one to solve the puzzle announces it to the whole network and other miners
validate the answer. If 51% of the other nodes validate the answer to be correct, a new block is created and the winner gets both the mining reward as well as the
transaction fees.

The problem with this approach is that all the miners started working to solve the same puzzle and mining consumes huge amount of energy and computing power which 
is wasteful. 



In proof of stake, there is no mining it's validation, forgers deposit some amount of cryptocurrency as a stake and the winner is chosen by an algorithm. 
According to the algo, more the amount of stake, more will be your chances of getting selected. Only the selected node will verify and validate the transactions
sign it and propose the block to the network for validation. All the other nodes in staking pool can attest the transaction. When a threshold number of attestations 
have been made, the network updates the blockchain. All the nodes in the staking pool gets the reward in proportion of their staked amount.
