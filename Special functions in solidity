recieve: recieve is a special reserved function to recieve ethers into contract's account that can be 
      . written only once in a contract 
      . without function keyword 
      . with external 
      . and payable declaration 
      . and no arguments
        e.g recieve() external payable { // You can write some code here or can leave this empty}

send: The send method is used to send Ether to a contract or to anindividually owned account
. The send function provides 2,300 gas as a fixed limit, which cannot be superseded.
. The send function returns a boolean true/false as a return value.
. In case failure, an exception is not returned; instead, false is returned from the function.
. In case of failure, your funds will not be returns and it will be hold by contract of the function which you have called
(Send function does not raise exception when fund is not transferred due to any reason That's why it's not recommended to use it)

transfer: The transfer method is similar to the send method.
. It is responsible for sending Ether or wei to an address. However, the difference here is that transfer raises anexception in the case of 
execution failure, instead of returning false, and all changes are reverted.
. The transfer method is preferred over the send method as it raises an exception in the event of an error, meaning exceptions are bubbled up 
in the stack and halt execution.
. In case of failure funds will not be deducted and it will stay in account which initiate the transaction
