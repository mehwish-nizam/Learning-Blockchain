Bytes array: Everything that will be stored in the byte array will be in the form of hexadecimal digits.
No square brackets required in declaration as in normal arrays
Single bytes in byte arrays cannot be modified. The whole array can be changed at once but one/two.. bytes cannot be modified.
contract Array{
bytes3 public b3; //3 bytes array
bytes2 public b2; //2 bytes array
function setter() public
 {
     b3='abc'; //Correct
     b3[0]='d' //Wrong
 }
}
              I
Padding of 0 is added at the end if the value(by which the array is initialized) does not occupy the entire space.
Bytes array can be of fixed size or dynamic.
Fixed size: e.g bytes1, bytes32,
Dynamic: e.g bytes
