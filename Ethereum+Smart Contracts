Ethereum:
    Ethereum is a programmable blockchain. Rather than give users a set of pre-defined operations (e.g. bitcoin transactions), Ethereum allows users to create 
    their own operations of any complexity they wish. In this way, it serves as a platform for many different types of decentralized blockchain applications, 
    including but not limited to cryptocurrencies.
    
    
    Accounts:
        In bitcoin UTXOs define the state of the bitcoin blockchain. But Ethereum includes account as a part of the protocol.
        Account is the originator and target of the transaction.
        
        Therea re two types of accounts
        1. Externally owned accounts(EOA): 
              Controlled by own private keys
        2. Contract Accounts: 
              Controlled by their contract code(smart contract) and can only be “activated” by an EOA
              Contract accounts only perform an operation when instructed to do so by an EOA. So it is not possible for a Contract account to be performing native 
              operations like random number generation or API calls it can do these things only if prompted by an EOA.
  
  
    Full node of ethereum blockchain consist of:
      Software needed for:
          Transaction
          Validation
          Mining
          Creation of block
          Smart contract execution
          Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM)
      
    
    The node of ethereum can make transaction for ether transfer and also can make transaction to exexute a CA (can be done only by EOA).
    Both types of transaction requires fee. Fee is paid in wei 1 Ether = 10^18 wei
    
    /************************Transaction of Ethereum*******************************************/
    Transaction of ethereum includes these informations
    * Reciepient
    * Signature of sender
    * Amount of wei (which sender wants to transfer)
    * Message/data/payload to smart cntract
    * STARTGAS (max # of computational steps)
    * GASPRICE (Fees for computation)

Smart Contract:
    Piece of code deployed in the blockchain node.
    This piece of code may include som criteria for transaction like if else condition or some time delay or any business logic.
    A currency transfer only involves addition and subtraction without any criteria that's why smart contracts aren't used in bitcoin(only crytocurrency) blockchain.
    Execution is initiated by a message embedded in transaction.
    Every node holds the same smart contract.
    Every node in the ethereum blockchain must be able to execute smart contract code irrespective of its hardware specification.
    Here comes the need for EVM(Ethereum virtual machine) which enables the node to execute smart contract.
    Smart contracts are written in high level language like solidity and cmpiled to byte code and then deployed to EVM.
    There can be multiple smart contracts deployed on single EVM.
  
  
Ethereum uses incentive model for block creation
Every action in ethereum requires gas fees
Gas measures the amount of work required for transaction
When it comes to actually paying for the gas, the transaction fee is charged as a certain number of ether
We do not measure effort/work directly in ether because ether is a cuurency whose value changes with market condition but the cost of computation should remain same

The transaction gets rejected if:
      The gasprice specied is very low, no miner will run your transaction(Message: your transaction not having a high enough fee)
      The gasprice is sufficient but the transaction results in too much computational work that the gast costs exceed the gasfee. The fee is paid to the miner for the 
      amount of work done from your account and the transaction is attached to the block as a failed transaction.
If the gasfees is higher than the cost then the unspent amount is returned to the originating account.


/*******************************INCENTIVE MODEL******************************/
According to incentive model, the winning miner gets the reward amount (3 ether) + transaction fee + gasfees
It may be possible that other miners also solve the mining puzzle, they are called ommers and the block created by them are called ommer blocks and are added as
a side block to the chain. These ommers also get a small percentage of gasfees
